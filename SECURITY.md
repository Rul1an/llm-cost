# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of `llm-cost` seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, please send a private report to the maintainer via GitHub Security Advisories or email (if listed).

**SLA**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Scope

- **In Scope**:
    - Vulnerabilities in the core binary that could lead to crashes (DoS) or unexpected data processing behavior.
    - Tokenizer inconsistencies that could lead to significant cost underestimation in `exact` mode.
- **Out of Scope**:
    - Build process exploits requiring compromised local environments.
    - Heuristic inaccuracies for unsupported models (these are expected).

## Supply Chain Security

We adhere to modern software supply chain security practices.

### 1. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
Every release includes an SBOM in CycloneDX format (`.cdx.json`), generated by [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft).

### 2. Code Signing (Cosign)
All release binaries are signed using [Sigstore Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) (keyless mode). Verify with `.sig` and `.crt` files.

### 3. Reproducible Builds
We pin Zig versions (e.g., `0.13.0`) in `build.zig` and CI. We guarantee build consistency via our automated release pipeline.

### 4. Privacy & Data Safety
`llm-cost` performs **no network calls** and sends **no telemetry**. All processing is 100% local.
